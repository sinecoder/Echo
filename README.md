## Echo VST3 plugin
 
Welcome to the Echo Plugin, my second app developed by integrating the functional programming language Faust with JUCE. I realized at the end of the production of this video that the DSP algorithm is in the standard library, specifically in misceffects.lib. I found the algorithm on: https://faustdoc.grame.fr/workshops/2020-04-10-faust-juce/. That tutorial on integrating Faust and JUCE seems to be a little outdated because, in my case, the final application didn't work properly. With a few modifications, I was able to resolve the issues.
## Installation
Download: Get the latest release from the Releases page. Install: Copy the VST3 file to your DAW's VST3 plugin folder:

- Windows: C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3
- macOS: soon !!!
